The first array's average is (3+4+1+3+5+1+4)/7. Let's calculate that sum: 3+4 is 7, plus 1 is 8, plus 3 is 11, plus 5 is 16, plus 1 is 17, plus 4 is 21. 21 divided by 7 is 3. Exactly. The second array's sum is 21+54=75, +33=108, +21=129, +77=206. 206 divided by 5 is 41.2. Sum of averages is 3 +41.2=44.2, then floor is 44.
