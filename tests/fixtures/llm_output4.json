What score does she need to get on the sixth quiz to make the arithmetic mean of the six scores equal 93?" }, { "from": "assistant", "value": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, let's see. Emily has taken five quizzes so far, and her scores are 92, 95, 87, 89, and 100. She wants to know what she needs to score on her sixth quiz so that the average of all six quizzes is 93. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the arithmetic mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are. So in this case, the mean of six quizzes should be 93. That means the total sum of all six quiz scores has to be 93 multiplied by 6. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal required sum = 93 * 6. Let me calculate that. 93 times 6... 90*6 is 540, and 3*6 is 18, so 540 + 18 = 558. So the total sum needs to be 558.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the quiz scores she already has. The scores are 92, 95, 87, 89, and 100. Let me add those up. Starting with 92 and 95: 92 + 95 is 187. Then add 87: 187 + 87 is 274. Then add 89: 274 + 89 is 363. Finally, add 100: 363 + 100 is 463. So the sum of her current scores is 463.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 92 + 95 is definitely 187. 187 + 87: 180 + 80 is 260, and 7 + 7 is 14, so 260 +14 = 274. Then 274 + 89: 200 + 80 = 280, 74 + 9 = 83, so 280 +83 = 363. Then 363 +100 = 463. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, the total she needs is 558, and she already has 463. Therefore, the sixth quiz score needed is 558 - 463. Let me do that subtraction. 558 minus 463. 558 - 400 is 158, then subtract 63 more: 158 - 60 is 98, minus 3 is 95. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 463 + 95 is 558? Let me check that. 463 + 90 is 553, then +5 is 558. Yes, that's correct. So Emily needs a 95 on her sixth quiz.\n\nWait a second, but let me verify again because sometimes when you do arithmetic quickly, you might slip. Let me add up her current scores once more:\n\n92, 95, 87, 89, 100.\n\nAdding 92 + 95: 92 + 95. 90 + 90 is 180, 2 +5 is 7, so 187. Then 187 + 87: 187 + 80 is 267, +7 is 274. Then 274 +89: 274 +80 is 354, +9 is 363. Then 363 +100 is 463. That's correct.\n\nTotal needed is 93*6=558. So 558 -463 =95. So yes, she needs a 95.\n\nWait, but hold on. If she already has a 95 in her previous quizzes, and she needs another 95, then that would make sense. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering how much each score deviates from the desired average.\n\nSo, the desired average is 93. Each of her previous scores can be compared to 93. Let's see:\n\nFirst quiz: 92. That's 1 below 93.\n\nSecond quiz: 95. That's 2 above 93.\n\nThird quiz: 87. That's 6 below 93.\n\nFourth quiz: 89. That's 4 below 93.\n\nFifth quiz: 100. That's 7 above 93.\n\nSo let's sum these deviations:\n\n-1 (from 92) +2 (from 95) -6 (from87) -4 (from89) +7 (from100). Let's calculate that.\n\nStart with -1 +2 = +1.\n\nThen +1 -6 = -5.\n\nThen -5 -4 = -9.\n\nThen -9 +7 = -2.\n\nSo overall, the total deviation from the desired average is -2. That means her current total is 2 less than the total needed for an average of 93 over five quizzes. Wait, but actually, the deviations are relative to 93. So if the desired average is 93 over six quizzes, then each quiz contributes (score -93) to the total deviation.\n\nBut since she has five quizzes, the total deviation so far is -2 (as calculated). To get an average of 93 over six quizzes, the total deviation needs to be 0. Therefore, the sixth quiz needs to have a deviation of +2 to balance it out. Therefore, the sixth quiz score is 93 +2 =95. That matches the previous result.\n\nSo that's another way to confirm. The deviations method also leads to the same answer. So that gives me more confidence that 95 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I set up an equation: Let x be the sixth score. Then, (92 +95 +87 +89 +100 +x)/6 =93. Multiply both sides by 6: 92 +95 +87 +89 +100 +x =558. Then sum the known scores: 463 +x=558. So x=558-463=95. Yep, same result.\n\nSo all methods lead to 95. Therefore, Emily needs to score 95 on her sixth quiz to have an average of 93.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nEmily needs to score 95 on her sixth quiz. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the Required Total Score:**\n To achieve an average of 93 over six quizzes, the total sum of scores must be:\n \\[\n 93 \\times 6 = 558\n \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Current Total Score:**\n Sum Emily's existing five quiz scores:\n \\[\n 92 + 95 + 87 + 89 + 100 = 463\n \\]\n\n3. **Find the Required Sixth Score:**\n Subtract the current total from the required total:\n \\[\n 558 - 463 = 95\n \\]\n\n**Verification via Deviations:**\n- Compare each score to 93 and sum the deviations:\n \\[\n (-1) + (+2) + (-6) + (-4) + (+7) = -2\n \\]\n- To balance the total deviation to 0, the sixth score must be:\n \\[\n 93 + 2 = 95\n \\]\n\n**Answer:** Emily needs a score of **95** on her sixth quiz.\n\n<|end_of_solution|>" } ]
