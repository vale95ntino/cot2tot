example_reasoning = "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Takahashi ate all the dishes in a certain order, and calculate his total satisfaction points. Hmm, the problem statement says that he ate N kinds of dishes once each, so the A array is a permutation of 1 to N. Because each dish is unique and all are eaten once. \n\nThe satisfaction comes from two parts. First, each dish gives B_i points. Wait, but the B array is ordered by the dish number, right? Like B_i is the base satisfaction for dish i. So when he eats dish A_j (the j-th in the order he ate), which is dish number, say, 3, then he gets B_3 points. Because the B array is indexed by the dish number. Wait, let me check the input format. The input gives B_1 B_2 ... B_N, which corresponds to dish 1 to N. So for each dish in the order he ate (A_1, A_2, ..., A_N), the base satisfaction is B[A_1 - 1] if we're using zero-based indexing. Wait, no: the A array elements are the dish numbers, so for each A_i in the sequence, the base satisfaction is B[A_i - 1] if the list is 0-based. Wait, no. Wait, the B array is given as B_1 to B_N, which are the satisfaction points for dish 1, dish 2, etc. So for example, if the i-th dish he ate is dish 3 (A_i =3), then the B value is B[2] in zero-based, which is B_3. So in code, when processing each A_i, we add B[A_i-1] to the total.\n\nThen, there's the additional C_i points. The condition is when he eats dish i+1 just after dish i. Wait, no. The problem says, when he eats dish i+1 just after dish i (for 1 <=i <=N-1), he gains C_i points. Wait, but the dishes he ate are in the sequence A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. So for each consecutive pair in this sequence, if the current dish is i and the next is i+1, then add C_i. So for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n3 1 2\nB is [2,5,4]\nC is [3,6]\n\nThe sequence of dishes he ate is 3,1,2.\n\nSo the base is B[3-1] = B[2] =4 (wait no, wait for dish 3, B_3 is 4. Because the third dish's B is B[3], right? Wait, the B array is B_1, B_2, B_3. So for dish 3 (A_1=3), B_3 is 4. So in code, for each A_i, we get B[A_i -1] because the index is 0-based. Then for consecutive dishes in the sequence, check if the current dish is x and next is x+1. For example, if the current dish is 1 and next is 2, then add C_1. Because C is given as C_1 ... C_{N-1}, which corresponds to i=1 to i=N-1. So for i from 1 to N-1, if the current dish is i and next is i+1, add C_i. Wait, but the dishes in the sequence can be any permutation. So for each j from 0 to N-2 (zero-based), check if A[j+1] is equal to A[j] +1. If yes, then add C[A[j]-1], because C_i is for dish i followed by i+1. For example, if in the sequence, two consecutive dishes are 2 and 3, then that's 2 followed by 3. So 2 is i here (since i+1 is 3), so we check if the current is i and next is i+1. Then add C_i. So in this case, i is 2, so we add C_2. Wait, but the C array is given as C_1, C_2, ..., C_{N-1}, which are for i from 1 to N-1. So in code, for each consecutive pair (x, y) in the sequence, if y == x+1, then add C[x-1]. Because x is the current dish, and x+1 is the next. So x ranges from 1 to N-1. So C's index is x-1 (since C is 0-based). For example, if x is 1, then C[0] (C_1 in the input). Wait, wait, the input's C array is given as C_1 to C_{N-1}, so the indexes are 0 to N-2 in code. So when x is i (current dish is i), and next is i+1, then we add C[i-1], because C_1 is the first element in the input array. For example, in sample input 1, the sequence is 3,1,2. The consecutive pairs are 3→1, 1→2. Let's check each:\n\n3→1: 3+1=4, which is not next. So no C added.\n\n1→2: 1+1=2. So next is 2, which is i+1. So here, i is 1, so we add C[0] which is 3. Then total for C is 3+6? Wait, sample input 1's C is 3 6. So C_1=3, C_2=6 (for N=3, N-1=2 C's). Wait, sample input 1 has C_1 and C_2? Wait the input is C1 C2 ... C_{N-1}. For N=3, N-1 is 2, so two elements. So for consecutive pairs:\n\nIn the sequence 3,1,2:\n\nFirst pair 3 and 1: 3 and 1, difference is -2. Not consecutive. So no C added.\n\nSecond pair 1 and 2: 1 and 2. So current is 1, next is 2. So check if current is i and next is i+1. i here is 1, so we add C_1 which is the first element in the C array. The C array given in sample 1 is 3 6. So C_1 is 3, C_2 is 6. So in this case, adding 3.\n\nThen the sum from C is 3.\n\nThen the base B is:\n\n3's B is B_3=4 (since B is [2,5,4], 0-based index 2 is 4)\n\n1's B is B_1=2 (0-based index 0)\n\n2's B is B_2=5 (0-based index 1)\n\nSo total B is 4+2+5=11. Plus the C's 3. Total 14, which matches sample 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sum all B[A_i -1] for each A_i in the sequence.\n\n2. For each consecutive pair in the sequence, check if the next dish is current dish +1. If yes, add C[current dish -1].\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nRead the A array as a list of integers.\n\nRead B array.\n\nRead C array.\n\nCompute total as sum of B[a-1] for each a in A.\n\nThen loop from i=0 to i=N-2:\n\ncurrent_dish = A[i]\n\nnext_dish = A[i+1]\n\nif next_dish == current_dish +1:\n\nthen add C[current_dish -1] to total.\n\nWait, but what if current_dish is N? Then current_dish+1 is N+1, which is out of bounds, but in that case, next_dish can't be N+1, since all dishes are 1..N. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nB = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nC = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor a in A:\n\n total += B[a-1]\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n current = A[i]\n\n next_dish = A[i+1]\n\n if next_dish == current +1:\n\n total += C[current-1]\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, let's test this with sample 1:\n\nSample 1:\n\nA is [3,1,2]\n\nB is [2,5,4]\n\nSo B[3-1] = B[2] =4. Then B[1-1]=2, B[2-1]=5. Sum is 4+2+5=11.\n\nThen for consecutive pairs:\n\n3 and 1: next is not 4. No.\n\n1 and 2: next is 2 which is 1+1. So current is 1, add C[0] which is 3. 11+3=14. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n2 3 4 1\n\nB: 13,5,8,24 (so B[2-1] =13? Wait, no. Wait, A is [2,3,4,1]. So for each a in A:\n\na=2: B[1] (since indexes 0-based) 5? Wait wait no, wait the B array is given as B_1 B_2 B_3 B_4. So for a=2, B[a-1] is B[1], which is 5. Then for a=3, B[2] is8, a=4: B[3] is24, a=1: B[0] is13. So sum is 5+8+24+13 = 5+8 is13, +24=37, +13=50. Then check consecutive pairs:\n\n2 →3: yes. current is2, next is3. So add C[2-1 -1? Wait, no. current is 2, so C[current-1] is C[1]. The C array is [45,9,15], since N=4, C has 3 elements (C_1, C_2, C_3). So for current=2, we take C[1] which is9.\n\nThen 3→4: next is4, current is3. So add C[3-1] = C[2], which is15.\n\nThen 4→1: next is1. Not consecutive. So total from C is 9+15=24. So total is 50+24=74. Which matches sample 2's output.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\nB:50,50\n\nC:50.\n\nSo base sum is 50 (for 1) +50 (for 2) =100.\n\nThen consecutive pair is 1→2. So add C[0] (current is1, C[1-1] =C[0] which is50. So total is 100+50=150. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work. So the function should read input, process as such, then output the total.\n\nNow, code in Python, but also ensure that the function is called. The problem says to generate an executable Python function that takes stdin as input and prints output, and call the function after definition.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the A array.\n\nRead B.\n\nRead C.\n\nCompute sum of B[a-1] for a in A.\n\nThen loop through consecutive pairs and add C where needed.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef main():\n import sys\n n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n B = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n C = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n total = sum(B[a-1] for a in A)\n for i in range(n-1):\n if A[i+1] == A[i] + 1:\n total += C[A[i]-1]\n print(total)\n\nmain()\n\nWait, but in the C array, the indices are for C_1 to C_{N-1}. So when current dish is i, and next is i+1, then we take C[i-1]. But for i=1, C[i-1] is C[0], which is correct. For example, if current is 1, then C_1 is the first element of the input. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the code should work. Let's test sample 3 again. The consecutive pair is 1 followed by 2. current is1, so C[1-1] =C[0] =50. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total satisfaction points Takahashi gained from eating all dishes in a specific order at an all-you-can-eat buffet. The satisfaction points come from two sources: the base points from each dish and additional points if consecutive dishes are eaten in a specific order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, we read the input values which include the number of dishes, the order in which dishes were eaten, the base satisfaction points for each dish, and the additional points for consecutive dishes.\n2. **Calculate Base Satisfaction**: Sum the base satisfaction points for each dish based on the order they were eaten.\n3. **Check Consecutive Dishes**: For each consecutive pair of dishes in the order they were eaten, check if they form a sequence where the next dish is exactly one more than the current dish. If they do, add the corresponding additional points from the given list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n import sys\n input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n idx = 0\n n = int(input[idx])\n idx += 1\n A = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n idx += n\n B = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n idx += n\n C = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + (n-1)]))\n \n total = sum(B[a - 1] for a in A)\n for i in range(n - 1):\n current = A[i]\n next_dish = A[i + 1]\n if next_dish == current + 1:\n total += C[current - 1]\n print(total)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list for easier processing. We sequentially read the number of dishes, the order of dishes, the base satisfaction points, and the additional points for consecutive dishes.\n2. **Base Satisfaction Calculation**: Using a generator expression, we sum up the base satisfaction points for each dish in the order they were eaten.\n3. **Consecutive Dishes Check**: We iterate through each consecutive pair of dishes in the order they were eaten. If the next dish is exactly one more than the current dish, we add the corresponding additional points from the list `C`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the total satisfaction by leveraging direct indexing and list comprehensions, ensuring clarity and performance. The overall complexity is linear with respect to the number of dishes, making it optimal for the given constraints.\n\n<|end_of_solution|>" # noqa: E501
